# LauzHack x BSA: Introduction to Solidity ([SLIDES](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NSuVj4s_uiKd0U7mTR0k5LMHwMdi-t2T/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=115816041756434628590&rtpof=true&sd=true), [RECORDING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L96cKZZsYgU))

The following repo contains the code written during the workshop held by the [Blockchain Student Association](https://bsaepfl.ch) in collaboration with Lauzhack.

If you want to try running the code you can copy-paste it in [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) and deploy it to interact with it.

If you're looking for more resources to learn solidity you can check [Patrick Collins' Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PatrickAlphaC) or [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) (a bit outdated but still good to understand key concepts).

Also if you're looking for a more pythonic way of writing smart contracts you can check out [Vyper](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/latest/index.html).
